# OpenAI Playground

This repo is just my attempt to play with OpenAI

In case you forget, run `pipenv shell` to get into the virtual environment, or
run `pipenv run gpt.py` to run the script.

To use this, put your API key in a file called `.env` in the root of the
project. The file should look like this:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
